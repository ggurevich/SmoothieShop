Step1

 Which recipe is loading at the very beginning in the Main.java?
 
	The recipe loaded into the line Recipe r = config.getRecipe("Green Smoothie");.
	Originally it was best smoothie but changed to green smoothie.
	
 What happens when you change the different ingredients inside that recipe and run the app?
 
 	The ingredients and instructions change based on what is listed
 	
Inside of main there is this command:
	        Recipe r = context.getBean("bestSmoothie", Recipe.class);
What happens if you change the name of “bestSmoothie” to a different one found in the recipe.xml?  Is there any change in the output of the app?


	The app will list the ingredients of the new recipe and create new directions based on them. The output will change to reflect this.
	
	
 What happens in the output when you add this line
		        logger.info(r.getName());
		        above 
        logger.info(printPretty("Ingredients:", r.getIngredients()));
        
        It outputs the name of the recipe above everything.
        
 Bonus Question – Can you make the printPretty method accept a String recipeName and make
			        it print out the recipe name?  
			        ***HINT – you’d have to change printPretty to accept another parameter of 
	                                String – if you get stuck ask for help but try first.
	                                
	Add String recipeName to parameters of printPretty method.  Added append for recipeName in method and added strings for recipe name in lines for output.
	
	
	
Step2
	
Question – Right click on the recipe.csv file to see what recipes are available and change the 
       “Best Smoothie” to a different recipe available.  How did this change the output?
	        Ex. Recipe r = config.getRecipe("Best Smoothie"); 
	        Ex. Recipe r = config.getRecipe(“Green Smoothie"); 


Bonus Question – Can you change the printPretty function to accommodate the name of the 
	                   recipe?

	both of the above were completed in step1
